My last project in Kiev Software Factory 
was related to porting the server application
running on Solaris, on another Unix platform - Linux.
It was called the "Document Server for Internet". 
Its function is to store and convert various types of documents, 
such as PDF, PS, PCL, MS DOC, etc).
This application was written for Windows and Solaris platform. 
We had two teams, who have ported to AIX and Linux.
Our team has ported to Linux platform (RedHat 5.7 64 bit).
My job was:
    - setup work and test environments on Windows, Solaris, Linux;
    - porting Windows and Solaris code to Linux;
    - writing Linux specific code;
    - fixing bugs (in 64 bit specific code);
    - writing Bash scripts for automate building and testing;
    - implement, fixing and run unit tests;    
    - make reports with tests result;
    
In this project I used the following tools:
